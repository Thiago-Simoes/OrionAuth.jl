- Implemented support for HMAC512
- Implemented algorithm check between .env and JWT alg
- Fixed compatibility following RFC
- Permissions can be added individually and directly, without role
- Email confirmation with secure token-based validation.
- Password reset functionality with secure token distribution and expiry.
